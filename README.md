Code for the note alias for Avrae

The code in the note.alias handles all of the arguments and most of the output formatting
The rest of the code is in notelib which is stored as a gvar
Similarly noteshelp is stored as a gvar

Finally there is the very simple qn.alias which also uses notelib and is a super-simple alias to access the functionality simply
